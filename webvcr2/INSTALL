WebVCR cvs 
(c) 2001 Wim Vandersmissen // wim@bofh.be

Requirements:
-------------
	Perl
	PHP 4.0.4pl1 (with mysql, and curl (http://curl.haxx.se)
	phpwebtools 0.2.3 (http://phpwebtools.sourceforge.net)
	Mysql 3.23.36
	Perl Modules (DBI, LWP, DBD::Mysql) #LWP not really needed anymore
	VCR (http://www.stack.nl/~brama/vcr/)  (and/or xawtv)

Installation:
-------------
	copy everything to a directory that's accessible via WWW
	e.g. /var/www/html/webvcr 

	cd to the directory where you installed the files
	and execute the following command

	$ perl -pi -e "s#/var/www/html/webvcr/settings\.php#/directory/where/you/installed/it/settings\.php#g" *.pl

	Xawtv or VCR
	------------
	If you haven't use vcr before you can just put a link 
	from ~/.vcrrc to ~/.xawtv
	If you have used vcr you know what the use of the ~/.vcrrc file is, if you
	don't -> RTFM
	
	Apache
	------

	Add "Alias /webvcr /var/www/html/webvcr" to your httpd.conf
	$ echo "Alias /webvcr /var/www/html/webvcr" >> /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

	Restart apache
	$ /etc/init.d/httpd restart

	Time to configure vcrweb point your browser to
	http://localhost/webvcr/init.php

	After initializing the database, don't forget to copy && paste the
	lines to settings.php , otherwise it won't work.	

	Now go to
	http://localhost/webvcr/config.php and set all your options
	(default options give the best quality/diskspace ratio for me)

	click on 'run collector' (choose advalvas for now)

	You'll be presented with a list of all possible stations (the program
	scans and parses the advalvas.be page). 

	Select the one you like to use (default all are enabled).
	Next you'll be presented a page with the station names, the right column
	must match the names you use in your ~/.xawtv (or ~/.vcrrc) file !! 
	
	Crontab
	-------
	Adding the necessary stuff to /etc/crontab
	vcr-cron.pl is the program that actually does the recording, and it needs
	to check the database every minute
	
	$ echo "* * * * * root /var/www/html/webvcr/vcr-cron.pl" >> /etc/crontab

	advalvas.pl connects to advalvas.be and parses the tv-listings and puts them
	into the database.
	$ cp /var/www/html/webvcr/advalvas.pl /etc/cron.daily/
	$ chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/advalvas.pl

	Or if you got the php binary with curl compiled in you can run
	$ php /var/www/html/webvcr/advalvas-slurp.php
	
	Ofcourse you can also browse to 
		http://localhost/webvcr/advalvas-slurp.php?WEB=1

RUNNING IT
----------
Just point your browser to http://localhost/webvcr/index.php

NOTES
-----
- Webvcr will complain if you try to record 2 programs of which the running time
  will collapse with other.
- Webvcr will start encoding programs 2 minutes before the start indicated on
  the TV listing, it will also ends 2 minutes later.
  This means that you can't 'record' 2 programs after eachother, you'll have
  to use the manually recording for that.
  If you want to change that behaviour you'll have to edit vcr-cron.pl
- Manually recorded programs will have priority over automatically recorded
  ones!
- Manually recorded programs will not be flushed from the database when the
  daily TV listing is being updated.
