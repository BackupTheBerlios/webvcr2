What?
-----

WebVcr 2 is a tool which enables you to record television programs with your
Video4Linux TV card trough a web browser. 
WebVCR 2 is based on WebVCR (developed by Wim "Dolphin" Vandermissen) but his 
project does not really work for european users so we decided to redesign it 
and implement a few features that makes it even more comfortable to use.
